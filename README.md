## MagicMirror Internet Monitor

This is a simple module for the MagicMirror project that monitors internet connectivity and displays the status on the mirror. It uses the `ping` command to check if a specified host is reachable and updates the display accordingly.

It also provides a simple interface to view the current status and ping results.
